# The Project

We are three students soon-to-be system and embeded engineers.
PleePlee is a small gardener robot we are building for our master's project.

# Location

This repository is about the location of the robot. The robot will be able to
move in a predefined area delimited at each corner by luminous landmark.
Each luminous landmark is built from LEDs and each corner will have a different
color.

The location is estimated with multiple datas:
  - the distance to each luminous landmark
  - the angle between the axis of the robot and each landmark
  - the position of the north
  - odometry
